# The default docker-compose.override file can use the "localhost" as the external name for testing web apps within the same dev machine.
# The ESHOP_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP environment variable is taken, by default, from the ".env" file defined like:
#     ESHOP_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP=localhost
# but values present in the environment vars at runtime will always override those defined inside the .env file
# An external IP or DNS name has to be used (instead localhost and the 10.0.75.1 IP) when testing the Web apps and the Xamarin apps from remote machines/devices using the same WiFi, for instance.
